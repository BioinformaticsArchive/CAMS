Welcome to use CAMS algotithm,the new alignment algorithm which is called CAMS (Chromatogram Alignment via Mass Spectrum) in is presented here to correct the retention time shifts among chromatograms automatically, effectively and rapidly. peaks of each chromatogram are detected based on Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and aligned against a reference chromatogram via the correlation of mass spectrum. The aligning procedure is accelerated by Fast Fourier Transform cross correlation and alignment quality can be guaranteed by the accuracy of mass spectrum. The presented method has been compared with several widely used alignment methods on real chromatographic datasets, which demonstrates that CAMS can preserve the shapes of peaks and has excellent alignment quality. Furthermore, CAMS method is implemented in MATLABÂ® language and available as an open source package at http://www. github.com/matchcoder/CAMS.
